- ‍💼 I work as a Google Cloud Consultant / Data Engineer at [Compeople](https://compeople.de), crafting enterprise cloud solutions with an amazing team!
- 🧑‍🎓 I'm a proud member of the [Cognitive Algorithms Lab](https://prof.bht-berlin.de/biessmann/calgo-lab-team/) over at Berliner Hochschule für Technik.
