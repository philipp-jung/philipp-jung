### Hallo Welt, ich bin Philipp 👋

I'm Philipp Jung, a data engineer living in Berlin. I'm really interested about anything related to data, and am probably working on something related at the moment!

- ✍️ I blog at [pljung.de](https://pljung.de), mostly about (you guessed it) data, but really about anything that interestes me.
- ‍💼 I work as a Data Engineer at [Verdane](https://verdane.com), trying to identify the most successful companies across Europe.
- 🧑‍🎓 I'm a proud member of the [Cognitive Algorithms Lab](https://prof.bht-berlin.de/biessmann/calgo-lab-team/) over at Berliner Hochschule für Technik.
- 📫 You can reach me via <first><last><at>posteo<dot>de - don't be shy, I usually reply to every single message I receive!
